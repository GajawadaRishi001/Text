A Python-based application that extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This project demonstrates how OCR can be utilized to identify and retrieve text from complex images with varying colors, sizes, and positions.

Features ✨
🔍 Extracts text from images with high accuracy.
📷 Handles complex, multi-colored, and non-uniform text layouts.
🛠️ Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
🌐 Utilizes pre-trained OCR models for reliable performance.
Tech Stack 🛠️
Python: Core programming language.
Tesseract-OCR: OCR engine for text recognition.
Pillow (PIL): Python Imaging Library for image processing.
How It Works 🔄
Preprocessing:

The input image is processed to enhance text visibility (e.g., grayscale conversion, thresholding).
Text Recognition:

The preprocessed image is passed to Tesseract-OCR, which extracts text.
Output:

Recognized text is displayed or saved in a text file for further use.
